      <li>My plan is to have a customer a list of transaction, it is more like a receipt coming from a store.</li>
      <li>I used the datasets from /r datasets from reddit contains the stores in provinces around Canada but I pick Manitoba for my data for now.</li>
      <li>I pulled my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/7v4jb5/grocery_datasets_for_canada/">DataSource</a> here.</li>
      <li> I will use those to create stores and products table, and for customers tables will be generated by faker gem. Transaction table will be
      based from products and customers.</li>
